        time to dust off that family disaster plan, or in many cases, create
        one. Keeping your family safe during a hurricane starts with proper
        planning.

        Tornadoes can destroy buildings, flip cars, and create deadly flying
        debris. Tornadoes are violently rotating columns of air that extend
        from a thunderstorm to the ground.<br/>
        Tornadoes can:

        <li>Happen anytime and anywhere;</li>
        <li>Bring intense winds, over 200 MPH; and</li>
        <li>Look like funnels.</li>

        Dogs Like Rain


        by P.A. Hosler


        Once upon a dream in another lifetime, cheese doodles frolicked in the
        Autumn mists of Brumbalee. One day it rained, and the dogs came out to
        play. Dogs being dogs, they ate the cheese doodles, because dogs
        **LOVE** cheese. The End... _or is it?_
