        time to dust off that family disaster plan, or in many cases, create
        one. Keeping your family safe during a hurricane starts with proper
        planning.

        Tornadoes can destroy buildings, flip cars, and create deadly flying
        debris. Tornadoes are violently rotating columns of air that extend from
        a thunderstorm to the ground.<br/> Tornadoes can:

        <li>Happen anytime and anywhere;</li> <li>Bring intense winds, over 200
        MPH; and</li> <li>Look like funnels.</li>

        Hurricanes are massive storm systems that form over warm ocean waters
        and move toward land. Potential threats from hurricanes include powerful
        winds, heavy rainfall, storm surges, coastal and inland flooding, rip
        currents, tornadoes, and landslides. The Atlantic hurricane season runs
        from June 1 to November 30. The Pacific hurricane season runs May 15 to
        November 30.<br/> Hurricanes:

        <li>Can happen along any U.S. coast or in any territory in the Atlantic
        or Pacific oceans.</li> <li>Can affect areas more than 100 miles
        inland.</li> <li>Are most active in September.</li>
